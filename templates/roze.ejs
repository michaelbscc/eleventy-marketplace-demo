                    <b>Gatis Roze</b>, MBA, CMT, is a veteran full-time stock market investor who has traded his own account since 1989 unburdened by the distraction of clients. He holds an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business,
                    is a past president of the Technical Securities Analysts Association (TSAA), and is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). After several successful entrepreneurial business ventures, Gatis retired in his early 40s to

                    investors in sold-out investment courses and seminars throughout the United States, regularly speaking to organizations including the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII), the Market Technicians Association
                    (MTA), Bellevue College and more.
